Don't Lose Your Marbles - A J2ME Demo game
This is a demo game I wrote years ago to show to a potential investor.
In the game, you need to place arrow markers to guide your marble hero to the exit.
You also need to rescue a number of marbles to proceed to the next level.
There's only one level in the demo game.
